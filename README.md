# app-katas

This is a collection of "app katas" to practice deploying complex applications
using open-source DevOps tools.

> Kata is a Japanese word (型 or 形) meaning "form". It refers to a detailed

The idea of "code katas" comes from [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/), one of
the authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), as a way to
bring that element of disciplined practice into software development.

Here we apply the idea of code katas to DevOps practice, by deploying various
apps using a common DevOps tech stack. Those are the "app katas" included in the
present repo.

## Stack

The stack is comprised of the following tools:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/)
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

Installation and configuration of these tools is outside the scope of this
document.
