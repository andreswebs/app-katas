# app-katas

This is a collection of "app katas" to practice deploying complex applications
using open-source DevOps tools.

> Kata is a Japanese word (型 or 形) meaning "form". It refers to a detailed
> choreographed pattern of martial arts movements made to be practised alone.
> [...] It is practised in Japanese martial arts as a way to memorize and
> perfect the movements being executed.

The idea of "code katas" comes from [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/), one of
the authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), as a way to
bring that element of disciplined practice into software development.

Here we apply this idea to DevOps practice, by deploying various apps using a
common DevOps tech stack.
